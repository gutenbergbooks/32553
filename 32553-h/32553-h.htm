I want a kitten all my own<br />

The very thing you'd like to see<br />
Within your stocking Christmas Day?"<br />
I wouldn't stop to think, (would you?)<br />
But say,<br />
"I want to drive the sleigh!"<br />
<br />
And then when Christmas Week had come,<br />
At nearly dawn on Christmas Day,<br />
I'd load the sleigh with doll and drum;<br />
And find where the reindeer were tied,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>And hitch them quickly up, and I'd<br />
Shout very loudly, "Clear the way!"<br />
<br />
And crack the whip and drive the sleigh<br />
Down from the Pole and past the clang<br />
Of loud icicles in a row,<br />
Blown by the wind, to where the gang<br />
Lives, in our street, and then I'd shout,<br />
While frightened heads of boys stuck out<br />
From opened windows, in surprise,<br />
With tousled hair and sleepy eyes,<br />
I'd shout out loudly so that they<br />
Could hear each single word I'd say,<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Hey, Dasher, Dancer!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Faster, Prancer!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Run as hard now as you can, sir!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stop your balking</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span><br />
Then I'd shake the reins and shout<br />
To milkmen that might be about,<br />

For Santa's sleigh,<br />
Because I'm driving it to-day!"<br />

All the Saturdays met one day<br />
(Each was very polite, they say),<br />
They shook each other by the hand,<br />

<br />
They wouldn't let any Monday in,<br />
And not one Tuesday at all could win<br />
Her way past the supercilious crowd!<br />
And Wednesdays&mdash;why, they weren't allowed!<br />
<br />
Thursdays could only stand in the street<br />
And look through the door at the things to eat!<br />
And the Fridays and Sundays pretended they<br />
Didn't like parties, anyway!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span><br />
But the Saturdays had the greatest fun!<br />
They played "Hop-scotch" and "Run-sheep-run,"<br />
And "Frog-in-the-meadow," and "Pull-away!"<br />
And everything else they wanted to play!<br />
<br />
They used the Throne for "Musical Chairs"<br />
As if the Fairy Queen's house were theirs!<br />
In rooms enchanted they ran and hid,<br />
And whatever they wished they could do, they did!<br />
<br />
And after they'd played and played and played,<br />
They had pink straws in their lemonade!<br />
And the cookies and tarts were like a dream!<br />
And all the Saturdays had ice-cream!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span><br />
I'd my doubts when I heard&mdash;And you have yours&mdash;<br />
But strange things happen on Foreign Shores!<br />
And they say that the best f&ecirc;te ever planned<br />
Was the Saturdays' party in Fairyland!<br />

<p>
It often rains in our town. And, you know,<br />
It always happens when we've planned to go<br />
On walks or hikes, or somewhere out to play;<br />
It's curious how it seems arranged that way!<br />
<br />
We used to use those rainy days to pout,<br />
And stand there at the window looking out<br />
And wishing things about the weather&mdash;oh,<br />
I never knew a wish to change it, though!<br />
<br />
But now&mdash;the gladdest secret! We don't need<br />
Our dad to tell us stories. We can read!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>We've found that Fairyland is everywhere&mdash;<br />
You open up a book and, why, you're there!<br />

<p>
Gardening is heaps of fun!<br />
We are partners with the sun,<br />
For we help him make things grow,<br />
With our spade and rake and hoe!<br />
<br />
First we spade the ground, then rake it;<br />
Ready for the seeds we make it;<br />
Then in furrows carefully<br />
Plant them as they ought to be.<br />
<br />
Soon above the ground we spy<br />
Tiny green things push and pry,<br />
Little plants that from their night<br />
Wake and climb to find the light.<br />
<br />
They are thirsty, so we give<br />
Water first that they may live;<br />
Then the weeds we vanquish, so<br />
Each wee shoot may thrive and grow.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span><br />
Busy raindrops, light, and air,<br />
Haste to come, our work to share.<br />
For to them too, every one,<br />
Gardening is heaps of fun!<br />
